# Open Education Polito Website

## Getting started

`bundle install`

You can build the site and make it available on a local server with:

`bundle exec jekyll serve --config _config.yml,_config_dev.yml`

### Notes

You can run the server just with `bundle exec jekyll serve`: the webiste will be available on http://localhost:4000/design-jeyll-theme. This is the default settings to allow usage with GitHub pages.

The aforementioned addition of `_config_dev.yml` is needed to run the server on http://localhost:4000 without any subpath.
